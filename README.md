# dsl-using-rust

Aim : write a DSL using rust. 

Learning : 
- Process of writing a formal grammar, parser, interpreter, data structures for the AST etc. is a good means of becoming more familiar with rust.
- Writing in parsers in rust will force some familiarity with macros

Facillitates : 
- Interesting to see how Enso (and other 'low code' projected) are redefining what it means to 'code'. We have traditionally seen coding as writing ascii into 
text files. But, text files are simply a convenient intermediary format, which is more convenient to construct than an AST. Writing parsers, tokenisers, interpreters etc. 
lays bare the artifice of connecting programming too closely with text files and ascii.
